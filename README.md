## Intro
There is a simple logger class located in logger.js that needs tests written and cleaned up.  
Clean up logger.js as you see fit and add tests to test/logger.js to validate the features shown in useLogger.js.

Add any review comments about the code to the notes file.

Please do not over think this, it should not take more than an hour.

### Install

### Run
```npm start```    Shows how the logger is used
